XSMCNP - A Utility for Converting Cross Section Data to MCNP Mupltigroup Format.

By converting the multigroup cross section data used in a deterministic simulation model to MCNP multigroup format, the same cross section data can be applied in the reference Monte Carlo simulation by running MCNP in multigroup mode. XSMCNP uses the MORSE treatment (discrete angle) to process scattering moments for the Legendre exapansion order P1 or higher.
