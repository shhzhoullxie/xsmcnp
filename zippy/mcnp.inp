title: sample multigroup input deck with mcard
c generated by xsmcnp, a code to convert PENTRAN xs (row format P0 only) to MCNP mg format
c group structure, fission chi and nu can be defined by optional input files of xsmcnp
c group upper bound defined in file : grp_erg.bnd (note: group 1 first)
c fission chi defined in file : grp_mat.chi or valid gmix format; note: chi(num_grp, num_mat)
c fission  nu defined in file : grp_mat.nu  or valid gmix format; note: nu(num_grp, num_mat)
c group structure default is 0.001MeV 1.0 2.0 3.0 ... or valid gmix format 
c chi by default is 1.0 for the first group, all other groups are zeros

c  cell cards
c  set cell density to 1.0, to make micro = macro xs
